# R_Programming
Programming R to 2023 Spring, mostly are my assignments and present how I solve problem.
In the begining professor taught us R's visualization, such as ggplot. Gradually, he started Machine Leanring Package. If you guys want to learn more about Machine Learning. I suggest you see my another reposity, called "Machine_Learning_by_R". This reposity contains a lot of statistic concepts not just how to use package from R.
